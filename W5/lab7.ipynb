Dounia endure great deal even difficult cases fortitude maintain firmness . not even write everything fear upsetting , although constantly communication . ended unexpectedly . Marfa Petrovna accidentally overheard husband imploring Dounia garden , , putting quite wrong interpretation position , threw blame upon , believing cause . awful scene took place spot garden ; Marfa Petrovna went far strike Dounia , refused hear anything shouting whole hour gave orders Dounia packed plain peasant ’ cart , flung things , linen clothes , pell-mell , without folding packing . heavy shower rain came , , Dounia , insulted put shame , drive peasant open cart seventeen versts town . think answer could sent letter received two months ago could written ? despair ; dared not write truth would unhappy , mortified indignant , yet could ? could perhaps ruin , , besides , Dounia would not allow ; fill my letter trifles my heart full sorrow , could not . whole month town full gossip scandal , came pass Dounia dared not even go church account contemptuous looks , whispers , even remarks made aloud us . acquaintances avoided us , nobody even bowed us street , learnt shopmen clerks intending insult us shameful way , smearing gates house pitch , landlord began tell us must leave . set going Marfa Petrovna managed slander Dounia throw dirt every family . knows everyone neighbourhood , month continually coming town , rather talkative fond gossiping family affairs particularly complaining husband -- not right -- short time spread story not town , but whole surrounding district . made ill , but Dounia bore better , could seen endured tried comfort cheer ! angel !

Moreover , evidence servants , , cleared Dounia ’ reputation ; seen known great deal Mr. Svidrigaïlov supposed -- indeed always case servants .

Razumihin one old comrades university . remarkable Raskolnikov hardly friends university ; kept aloof everyone , went see no one , not welcome anyone came see , indeed everyone soon gave . took no part students ’ gatherings , amusements conversations . worked great intensity without sparing , respected , but no one liked . poor , sort haughty pride reserve , though keeping something . seemed comrades look upon children , though superior development , knowledge convictions , though beliefs interests beneath . Razumihin got , , least , unreserved communicative . Indeed impossible terms Razumihin . exceptionally good-humoured candid youth , good-natured point simplicity , though depth dignity lay concealed simplicity . better comrades understood , fond . extremely intelligent , though certainly rather simpleton times . striking appearance -- tall , thin , black-haired always badly shaved . sometimes uproarious reputed great physical strength . One night , festive company , one blow laid gigantic policeman back . no limit drinking powers , but could abstain drink altogether ; sometimes went far pranks ; but could without pranks altogether . Another thing striking Razumihin , no failure distressed , seemed though no unfavourable circumstances could crush . could lodge anywhere , bear extremes cold hunger . poor , kept entirely could earn work one sort another . knew no end resources earn money . spent one whole winter without lighting stove , used declare liked better , one slept soundly cold . present , , obliged give university , but time , working might save enough return studies . Raskolnikov not see last four months , Razumihin not even know address . two months , met street , but Raskolnikov turned away even crossed side might not observed . though Razumihin noticed , passed , not want annoy . CHAPTER V “ course , ’ meaning lately go Razumihin ’ ask work , ask get lessons something ... ” Raskolnikov thought , “ but help ? Suppose gets lessons , suppose shares last farthing , farthings , could get boots make tidy enough give lessons ... hm ... Well ? shall coppers earn ? ’ not want . ’ really absurd go Razumihin .... ” question going Razumihin agitated even aware ; kept uneasily seeking sinister significance apparently ordinary action . “ Could expected set straight find way means Razumihin alone ? ” asked perplexity . pondered rubbed forehead , , strange say , long musing , suddenly , spontaneously chance , fantastic thought came head . “ Hm ... Razumihin ’ , ” said , calmly , though reached final determination . “ shall go Razumihin ’ course , but ... not . shall go ... next day , everything begin afresh .... ” suddenly realised thinking . “ , ” shouted , jumping seat , “ but really going happen ? possible really happen ? ” left seat , went almost run ; meant turn back , homewards , but thought going home suddenly filled intense loathing ; hole , awful little cupboard , _this_ month past growing ; walked random . nervous shudder passed fever made feel shivering ; spite heat felt cold . kind effort began almost unconsciously , inner craving , stare objects , though looking something distract attention ; but not succeed , kept dropping every moment brooding . start lifted head looked round , forgot thinking even going . way walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov , came Lesser Neva , crossed bridge turned towards islands . greenness freshness first restful weary eyes dust town huge houses hemmed weighed upon . no taverns , no stifling closeness , no stench . But soon new pleasant sensations passed morbid irritability . Sometimes stood still brightly painted summer villa standing among green foliage , gazed fence , saw distance smartly dressed women verandahs balconies , children running gardens . flowers especially caught attention ; gazed longer anything . met , , luxurious carriages men women horseback ; watched curious eyes forgot vanished sight . stood still counted money ; found thirty copecks . “ Twenty policeman , three Nastasya letter , must given forty-seven fifty Marmeladovs yesterday , ” thought , reckoning unknown reason , but soon forgot object taken money pocket . recalled passing eating-house tavern , felt hungry .... Going tavern drank glass vodka ate pie sort . finished eating walked away . long since taken vodka effect upon , though drank wineglassful . legs felt suddenly heavy great drowsiness came upon . turned homewards , but reaching Petrovsky Ostrov stopped completely exhausted , turned road bushes , sank upon grass instantly fell asleep . morbid condition brain , dreams often singular actuality , vividness , extraordinary semblance reality . times monstrous images created , but setting whole picture truth-like filled details delicate , unexpectedly , but artistically consistent , dreamer , artist like Pushkin Turgenev even , could never invented waking state . sick dreams always remain long memory make powerful impression overwrought deranged nervous system . Raskolnikov fearful dream . dreamt back childhood little town birth . child seven years old , walking country father evening holiday . grey heavy day , country exactly remembered ; indeed recalled far vividly dream done memory . little town stood level flat bare hand , not even willow near ; far distance , copse lay , dark blur edge horizon . paces beyond last market garden stood tavern , big tavern , always aroused feeling aversion , even fear , walked father . always crowd , always shouting , laughter abuse , hideous hoarse singing often fighting .

But , always asking , important , decisive time absolutely chance meeting happened Hay Market ( moreover no reason go ) hour , minute life mood circumstances meeting able exert gravest decisive influence whole destiny ? though lying wait purpose ! nine ’ clock crossed Hay Market . tables barrows , booths shops , market people closing establishments clearing away packing wares , like customers , going home . Rag pickers costermongers kinds crowding round taverns dirty stinking courtyards Hay Market . Raskolnikov particularly liked place neighbouring alleys , wandered aimlessly streets . rags not attract contemptuous attention , one could walk attire without scandalising people . corner alley huckster wife two tables set tapes , thread , cotton handkerchiefs , etc . , , got go home , but lingering conversation friend , come . friend Lizaveta Ivanovna , , everyone called , Lizaveta , younger sister old pawnbroker , Alyona Ivanovna , Raskolnikov visited previous day pawn watch make _experiment_ .... already knew Lizaveta knew little . single woman thirty-five , tall , clumsy , timid , submissive almost idiotic . complete slave went fear trembling sister , made work day night , even beat . standing bundle huckster wife , listening earnestly doubtfully . talking something special warmth . moment Raskolnikov caught sight , overcome strange sensation intense astonishment , though nothing astonishing meeting . “ could make mind , Lizaveta Ivanovna , ” huckster saying aloud . “ Come round to-morrow seven . too. ” “ To-morrow ? ” said Lizaveta slowly thoughtfully , though unable make mind . “ Upon my word , fright Alyona Ivanovna , ” gabbled huckster ’ wife , lively little woman . “ look , like little babe . not sister either -- nothing but step-sister hand keeps ! ” “ But time ’ say word Alyona Ivanovna , ” husband interrupted ; “ ’ my advice , but come round us without asking . worth .

Raskolnikov passed heard no . passed softly , unnoticed , trying not miss word . first amazement followed thrill horror , like shiver running spine . learnt , suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt , next day seven ’ clock Lizaveta , old woman ’ sister companion , would away home therefore seven ’ clock precisely old woman _would left alone_ . steps lodging . went like man condemned death . thought nothing incapable thinking ; but felt suddenly whole no freedom thought , no , everything suddenly irrevocably decided . Certainly , wait whole years suitable opportunity , could not reckon certain step towards success plan presented . case , would difficult find beforehand certainty , greater exactness less risk , without dangerous inquiries investigations , next day certain time old woman , whose life attempt contemplated , would home entirely alone . CHAPTER VI Later Raskolnikov happened find huckster wife invited Lizaveta . ordinary matter nothing exceptional . family come town reduced poverty selling household goods clothes , women ’ things . things would fetched little market , looking dealer . Lizaveta ’ business . undertook jobs frequently employed , honest always fixed fair price stuck . spoke rule little , said already , submissive timid . But Raskolnikov become superstitious late . traces superstition remained long , almost ineradicable . always afterwards disposed see something strange mysterious , , presence peculiar influences coincidences . previous winter student knew called Pokorev , left Harkov , chanced conversation give address Alyona Ivanovna , old pawnbroker , case might want pawn anything . long not go , lessons managed get along somehow . Six weeks ago remembered address ; two articles could pawned : father ’ old silver watch little gold ring three red stones , present sister parting . decided take ring . found old woman felt insurmountable repulsion first glance , though knew nothing special . got two roubles went miserable little tavern way home . asked tea , sat sank deep thought . strange idea pecking brain like chicken egg , , much absorbed . Almost beside next table sitting student , not know never seen , young officer . played game billiards began drinking tea . heard student mention officer pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna give address . seemed strange Raskolnikov ; come heard name . course chance , but could not shake extraordinary impression , someone seemed speaking expressly ; student began telling friend various details Alyona Ivanovna . “ first-rate , ” said . “ always get money . rich Jew , give five thousand roubles time not taking pledge rouble . Lots fellows dealings . But awful old harpy .... ” began describing spiteful uncertain , day late interest pledge lost ; gave quarter value article took five even seven percent month . student chattered , saying sister Lizaveta , wretched little creature continually beating , kept complete bondage like small child , though Lizaveta least six feet high . “ ’ phenomenon , ” cried student laughed . began talking Lizaveta . student spoke peculiar relish continually laughing officer listened great interest asked send Lizaveta mending . Raskolnikov not miss word learned everything . Lizaveta younger old woman half-sister , child different mother . thirty-five . worked day night sister , besides cooking washing , sewing worked charwoman gave sister earned . not dare accept order job kind without sister ’ permission . old woman already made , Lizaveta knew , would not get farthing ; nothing but movables , chairs ; money left monastery province N -- -- , prayers might said perpetuity . Lizaveta lower rank sister , unmarried awfully uncouth appearance , remarkably tall long feet looked bent outwards . always wore battered goatskin shoes , clean person . student expressed surprise amusement fact Lizaveta continually child . “ But say hideous ? ” observed officer . “ Yes , dark-skinned looks like soldier dressed , but know not hideous . good-natured face eyes . Strikingly . proof lots people attracted . soft , gentle creature , ready put anything , always willing , willing anything . smile really sweet. ” “ seem find attractive , ” laughed officer . “ queerness . No , ’ tell . could kill damned old woman make money , assure , without faintest conscience-prick , ” student added warmth . officer laughed Raskolnikov shuddered . strange ! “ Listen , want ask serious question , ” student said hotly . “ joking course , but look ; one side stupid , senseless , worthless , spiteful , ailing , horrid old woman , not simply useless but actual mischief , not idea living , die day two case . understand ? understand ? ” “ Yes , yes , understand , ” answered officer , watching excited companion attentively . “ Well , listen . side , fresh young lives thrown away want help thousands , every side ! hundred thousand good deeds could done helped , old woman ’ money buried monastery ! Hundreds , thousands perhaps , might set right path ; dozens families saved destitution , ruin , vice , Lock hospitals -- money . Kill , take money help devote oneself service humanity good . think , would not one tiny crime wiped thousands good deeds ? one life thousands would saved corruption decay . One death , hundred lives exchange -- ’ simple arithmetic ! Besides , value life sickly , stupid , ill-natured old woman balance existence ! No life louse , black-beetle , less fact old woman harm . wearing lives others ; day bit Lizaveta ’ finger spite ; almost amputated. ” “ course not deserve live , ” remarked officer , “ but , ’ nature. ” “ Oh , well , brother , but correct direct nature , , but , drown ocean prejudice . But , would never single great man . talk duty , conscience -- ’ want say anything duty conscience ; -- but point , mean ? Stay , another question ask . Listen ! ” “ No , stay , ’ ask question . Listen ! ” “ Well ? ” “ talking speechifying away , but tell , would kill old woman _yourself_ ? ” “ course not ! arguing justice .... ’ nothing .... ” “ But think , would not , ’ no justice .... Let us another game. ” Raskolnikov violently agitated . course , ordinary youthful talk thought , often heard different forms different themes . But happened hear discussion ideas moment brain conceiving ... _the ideas_ ? , moment brought away embryo idea old woman dropped upon conversation ? coincidence always seemed strange . trivial talk tavern immense influence later action ; though really something preordained , guiding hint .... * * * * * returning Hay Market flung sofa sat whole hour without stirring . Meanwhile got dark ; no candle , indeed , not occur light . could never recollect whether thinking anything time . last conscious former fever shivering , realised relief could lie sofa . Soon heavy , leaden sleep came , crushing . slept extraordinarily long time without dreaming . Nastasya , coming room ten ’ clock next morning , difficulty rousing . brought tea bread . tea second brew tea-pot . “ My goodness , sleeps ! ” cried indignantly . “ always asleep. ” got effort . head ached , stood , took turn garret sank back sofa . “ Going sleep , ” cried Nastasya . “ ill , eh ? ” made no reply . “ want tea ? ” “ Afterwards , ” said effort , closing eyes turning wall . Nastasya stood . “ Perhaps really ill , ” said , turned went . came two ’ clock soup . lying . tea stood untouched . Nastasya felt positively offended began wrathfully rousing . “ lying like log ? ” shouted , looking repulsion . got , sat , but said nothing stared floor . “ ill not ? ” asked Nastasya received no answer . “ ’ better go get breath air , ” said pause . “ eat not ? ” “ Afterwards , ” said weakly . “ go. ” motioned . remained little longer , looked compassion went . minutes afterwards , raised eyes looked long tea soup . took bread , took spoon began eat . ate little , three four spoonfuls , without appetite , mechanically . head ached less . meal stretched sofa , but could not sleep ; lay without stirring , face pillow . haunted day-dreams strange day-dreams ; one , kept recurring , fancied Africa , Egypt , sort oasis . caravan resting , camels peacefully lying ; palms stood around complete circle ; party dinner . But drinking water spring flowed gurgling close . cool , wonderful , wonderful , blue , cold water running among parti-coloured stones clean sand glistened like gold .... Suddenly heard clock strike . started , roused , raised head , looked window , seeing late , suddenly jumped wide awake though someone pulled sofa . crept tiptoe door , stealthily opened began listening staircase . heart beat terribly . But quiet stairs everyone asleep .... seemed strange monstrous could slept forgetfulness previous day done nothing , prepared nothing yet .... meanwhile perhaps struck six . drowsiness stupefaction followed extraordinary , feverish , distracted haste . But preparations made . concentrated energies thinking everything forgetting nothing ; heart kept beating thumping could hardly breathe . First make noose sew overcoat -- work moment . rummaged pillow picked amongst linen stuffed away , worn , old unwashed shirt . rags tore long strip , couple inches wide sixteen inches long . folded strip two , took wide , strong summer overcoat stout cotton material ( outer garment ) began sewing two ends rag inside , left armhole . hands shook sewed , but successfully nothing showed outside put coat . needle thread got ready long lay table piece paper . noose , ingenious device ; noose intended axe . impossible carry axe street hands . hidden coat would still support hand , would noticeable . put head axe noose , would hang quietly arm inside . Putting hand coat pocket , could hold end handle way , not swing ; coat full , regular sack fact , could not seen outside holding something hand pocket . noose , , designed fortnight . finished , thrust hand little opening sofa floor , fumbled left corner drew _pledge_ , got ready long hidden . pledge , however , smoothly planed piece wood size thickness silver cigarette case . picked piece wood one wanderings courtyard sort workshop . Afterwards added wood thin smooth piece iron , also picked time street . Putting iron little smaller piece wood , fastened firmly , crossing re-crossing thread round ; wrapped carefully daintily clean white paper tied parcel would difficult untie . order divert attention old woman time , trying undo knot , gain moment . iron strip added give weight , woman might not guess first minute “ thing ” made wood . stored beforehand sofa . got pledge heard someone suddenly yard . “ struck six long ago. ” “ Long ago ! My God ! ” rushed door , listened , caught hat began descend thirteen steps cautiously , noiselessly , like cat . still important thing -- steal axe kitchen . deed must done axe decided long ago . also pocket pruning-knife , but could not rely knife still less strength , resolved finally axe . may note passing , one peculiarity regard final resolutions taken matter ; one strange characteristic : final , hideous absurd became eyes . spite agonising inward struggle , never single instant time could believe carrying plans . , indeed , ever happened everything least point could considered finally settled , no uncertainty kind remained , would , seems , renounced something absurd , monstrous impossible . But whole mass unsettled points uncertainties remained . getting axe , trifling business cost no anxiety , nothing could easier . Nastasya continually house , especially evenings ; would run neighbours shop , always left door ajar . one thing landlady always scolding . , time came , would go quietly kitchen take axe , hour later ( everything ) go put back . But doubtful points . Supposing returned hour later put back , Nastasya come back spot . would course go wait till went . But supposing meantime miss axe , look , make outcry -- would mean suspicion least grounds suspicion . But trifles not even begun consider , indeed no time . thinking chief point , put trifling details , _he could believe all_ . But seemed utterly unattainable . seemed least . could not imagine , instance , would sometime leave thinking , get simply go .... Even late experiment ( i.e . visit object final survey place ) simply attempt experiment , far real thing , though one say “ come , let us go try -- dream ! ” -- broken run away cursing , frenzy . Meanwhile would seem , regards moral question , analysis complete ; casuistry become keen razor , could not find rational objections . But last resort simply ceased believe , doggedly , slavishly sought arguments directions , fumbling , though someone forcing drawing . first -- long indeed -- much occupied one question ; almost crimes badly concealed easily detected , almost criminals leave obvious traces ? come gradually many different curious conclusions , opinion chief reason lay not much material impossibility concealing crime , criminal . Almost every criminal subject failure reasoning power childish phenomenal heedlessness , instant prudence caution essential . conviction eclipse reason failure power attacked man like disease , developed gradually reached highest point perpetration crime , continued equal violence moment crime longer shorter time , according individual case , passed like disease . question whether disease gives rise crime , whether crime peculiar nature always accompanied something nature disease , not yet feel able decide . reached conclusions , decided case could not morbid reaction , reason would remain unimpaired time carrying design , simple reason design “ not crime .... ” omit process means arrived last conclusion ; run far ahead already .... may add practical , purely material difficulties affair occupied secondary position mind . “ One but keep one ’ will-power reason deal , overcome time one familiarised oneself minutest details business .... ” But preparation never begun . final decisions came trust least , hour struck , came pass quite differently , accidentally unexpectedly . One trifling circumstance upset calculations , even left staircase . reached landlady ’ kitchen , door open usual , glanced cautiously see whether , Nastasya ’ absence , landlady , not , whether door room closed , might not peep went axe . But amazement suddenly saw Nastasya not home kitchen , but occupied , taking linen basket hanging line . Seeing , left hanging clothes , turned stared time passing . turned away eyes , walked past though noticed nothing . But end everything ; not axe ! overwhelmed . “ made think , ” reflected , went gateway , “ made think would sure not home moment ! , , assume certainly ? ” crushed even humiliated . could laughed anger .... dull animal rage boiled within . stood hesitating gateway . go street , go walk appearance ’ sake revolting ; go back room , even revolting . “ chance lost ever ! ” muttered , standing aimlessly gateway , opposite porter ’ little dark room , also open . Suddenly started . porter ’ room , two paces away , something shining bench right caught eye .... looked -- nobody . approached room tiptoe , went two steps faint voice called porter . “ Yes , not home ! Somewhere near though , yard , door wide open. ” dashed axe ( axe ) pulled bench , lay two chunks wood ; , going , made fast noose , thrust hands pockets went room ; no one noticed ! “ reason fails , devil helps ! ” thought strange grin . chance raised spirits extraordinarily . walked along quietly sedately , without hurry , avoid awakening suspicion . scarcely looked passers-by , tried escape looking faces , little noticeable possible . Suddenly thought hat . “ Good heavens ! money day yesterday not get cap wear instead ! ” curse rose bottom soul . Glancing corner eye shop , saw clock wall ten minutes past seven . make haste time go someway round , approach house side .... happened imagine beforehand , sometimes thought would much afraid . But not much afraid , not afraid , indeed . mind even occupied irrelevant matters , but nothing long . passed Yusupov garden , deeply absorbed considering building great fountains , refreshing effect atmosphere squares . degrees passed conviction summer garden extended field Mars , perhaps joined garden Mihailovsky Palace , would splendid thing great benefit town . interested question great towns men not simply driven necessity , but peculiar way inclined live parts town no gardens fountains ; dirt smell sorts nastiness . walks Hay Market came back mind , moment waked reality . “ nonsense ! ” thought , “ better think nothing ! ” “ probably men led execution clutch mentally every object meets way , ” flashed mind , but simply flashed , like lightning ; made haste dismiss thought .... near ; house , gate . Suddenly clock somewhere struck . “ ! half-past seven ? Impossible , must fast ! ” Luckily , everything went well gates . moment , though expressly benefit , huge waggon hay driven gate , completely screening passed gateway , waggon scarcely time drive yard , slipped flash right . side waggon could hear shouting quarrelling ; but no one noticed no one met . Many windows looking huge quadrangular yard open moment , but not raise head -- not strength . staircase leading old woman ’ room close , right gateway . already stairs .... Drawing breath , pressing hand throbbing heart , feeling axe setting straight , began softly cautiously ascending stairs , listening every minute . But stairs , , quite deserted ; doors shut ; met no one . One flat indeed first floor wide open painters work , but not glance . stood still , thought minute went . “ course would better not , but ... ’ two storeys them. ” fourth storey , door , flat opposite , empty one . flat underneath old woman ’ apparently empty also ; visiting card nailed door torn -- gone away ! ... breath . one instant thought floated mind , “ Shall go back ? ” But made no answer began listening old woman ’ door , dead silence . listened staircase , listened long intently ... looked last time , pulled together , drew , tried axe noose . “ pale ? ” wondered . “ not evidently agitated ? mistrustful .... better wait little longer ... till my heart leaves thumping ? ” But heart not leave . contrary , though spite , throbbed violently . could stand no longer , slowly put hand bell rang . Half minute later rang , loudly . No answer . go ringing useless place . old woman , course , home , but suspicious alone . knowledge habits ... put ear door . Either senses peculiarly keen ( difficult suppose ) , sound really distinct . Anyway , suddenly heard something like cautious touch hand lock rustle skirt door . Someone standing stealthily close lock outside secretly listening within , seemed ear door .... moved little purpose muttered something aloud might not appearance hiding , rang third time , but quietly , soberly , without impatience , Recalling afterwards , moment stood mind vividly , distinctly , ever ; could not make cunning , mind clouded moments almost unconscious body .... instant later heard latch unfastened . CHAPTER VII door opened tiny crack , two sharp suspicious eyes stared darkness . Raskolnikov lost head nearly made great mistake . Fearing old woman would frightened alone , not hoping sight would disarm suspicions , took hold door drew towards prevent old woman attempting shut . Seeing not pull door back , but not let go handle almost dragged stairs . Seeing standing doorway not allowing pass , advanced straight upon . stepped back alarm , tried say something , but seemed unable speak stared open eyes . “ Good evening , Alyona Ivanovna , ” began , trying speak easily , but voice would not obey , broke shook . “ come ... brought something ... but ’ better come ... light .... ” leaving , passed straight room uninvited . old woman ran ; tongue unloosed . “ Good heavens ! ? ? want ? ” “ , Alyona Ivanovna , know ... Raskolnikov ... , brought pledge promised day ... ” held pledge . old woman glanced moment pledge , but stared eyes uninvited visitor . looked intently , maliciously mistrustfully . minute passed ; even fancied something like sneer eyes , though already guessed everything . felt losing head , almost frightened , frightened look like not say word another half minute , thought would run away . “ look though not know ? ” said suddenly , also malice . “ Take like , not ’ go elsewhere , hurry. ” not even thought saying , but suddenly said . old woman recovered , visitor ’ resolute tone evidently restored confidence . “ But , my good sir , minute .... ? ” asked , looking pledge . “ silver cigarette case ; spoke last time , know. ” held hand . “ But pale , sure ... hands trembling ? bathing , ? ” “ Fever , ” answered abruptly . “ ’ help getting pale ... ’ nothing eat , ” added , difficulty articulating words . strength failing . But answer sounded like truth ; old woman took pledge . “ ? ” asked , scanning Raskolnikov intently , weighing pledge hand . “ thing ... cigarette case .... Silver .... Look it. ” “ not seem somehow like silver .... wrapped ! ” Trying untie string turning window , light ( windows shut , spite stifling heat ) , left altogether seconds stood back . unbuttoned coat freed axe noose , but not yet take altogether , simply holding right hand coat . hands fearfully weak , felt every moment growing numb wooden . afraid would let axe slip fall .... sudden giddiness came . “ But tied like ? ” old woman cried vexation moved towards . not minute lose . pulled axe quite , swung arms , scarcely conscious , almost without effort , almost mechanically , brought blunt side head . seemed not use strength . But soon brought axe , strength returned . old woman always bareheaded . thin , light hair , streaked grey , thickly smeared grease , plaited rat ’ tail fastened broken horn comb stood nape neck . short , blow fell top skull . cried , but faintly , suddenly sank heap floor , raising hands head . one hand still held “ pledge. ” dealt another another blow blunt side spot . blood gushed overturned glass , body fell back . stepped back , let fall , bent face ; dead . eyes seemed starting sockets , brow whole face drawn contorted convulsively . laid axe ground near dead body felt pocket ( trying avoid streaming body ) -- right-hand pocket taken key last visit . full possession faculties , free confusion giddiness , but hands still trembling . remembered afterwards particularly collected careful , trying time not get smeared blood .... pulled keys , , , one bunch steel ring . ran bedroom . small room whole shrine holy images . wall stood big bed , clean covered silk patchwork wadded quilt . third wall chest drawers . Strange say , soon began fit keys chest , soon heard jingling , convulsive shudder passed . suddenly felt tempted give go away . But instant ; late go back . positively smiled , suddenly another terrifying idea occurred mind . suddenly fancied old woman might still alive might recover senses . Leaving keys chest , ran back body , snatched axe lifted old woman , but not bring . no doubt dead . Bending examining closely , saw clearly skull broken even battered one side . feel finger , but drew back hand indeed evident without . Meanwhile perfect pool blood . noticed string neck ; tugged , but string strong not snap besides , soaked blood . tried pull front dress , but something held prevented coming . impatience raised axe cut string body , but not dare , difficulty , smearing hand axe blood , two minutes ’ hurried effort , cut string took without touching body axe ; not mistaken -- purse . string two crosses , one Cyprus wood one copper , image silver filigree , small greasy chamois leather purse steel rim ring . purse stuffed full ; Raskolnikov thrust pocket without looking , flung crosses old woman ’ body rushed back bedroom , time taking axe . terrible haste , snatched keys , began trying . But unsuccessful . would not fit locks . not much hands shaking , but kept making mistakes ; though saw instance key not right one would not fit , still tried put . Suddenly remembered realised big key deep notches , hanging small keys could not possibly belong chest drawers ( last visit struck ) , but strong box , everything perhaps hidden box . left chest drawers , felt bedstead , knowing old women usually keep boxes beds . ; good-sized box bed , least yard length , arched lid covered red leather studded steel nails . notched key fitted unlocked . top , white sheet , coat red brocade lined hareskin ; silk dress , shawl seemed though nothing but clothes . first thing wipe blood-stained hands red brocade . “ ’ red , red blood less noticeable , ” thought passed mind ; suddenly came . “ Good God , going my senses ? ” thought terror . But no sooner touch clothes gold watch slipped fur coat . made haste turn . turned various articles made gold among clothes -- probably pledges , unredeemed waiting redeemed -- bracelets , chains , ear-rings , pins things . cases , others simply wrapped newspaper , carefully exactly folded , tied round tape . Without delay , began filling pockets trousers overcoat without examining undoing parcels cases ; but not time take many .... suddenly heard steps room old woman lay . stopped short still death . But quiet , must fancy . heard distinctly faint cry , though someone uttered low broken moan . dead silence minute two . sat squatting heels box waited holding breath . Suddenly jumped , seized axe ran bedroom . middle room stood Lizaveta big bundle arms . gazing stupefaction murdered sister , white sheet seeming not strength cry . Seeing run bedroom , began faintly quivering , like leaf , shudder ran face ; lifted hand , opened mouth , but still not scream . began slowly backing away corner , staring intently , persistently , but still uttered no sound , though could not get breath scream . rushed axe ; mouth twitched piteously , one sees babies ’ mouths , begin frightened , stare intently frightens point screaming . hapless Lizaveta simple thoroughly crushed scared not even raise hand guard face , though necessary natural action moment , axe raised face . put empty left hand , but not face , slowly holding though motioning away . axe fell sharp edge skull split one blow top head . fell heavily . Raskolnikov completely lost head , snatching bundle , dropped ran entry . Fear gained mastery , especially second , quite unexpected murder . longed run away place fast possible . moment capable seeing reasoning correctly , able realise difficulties position , hopelessness , hideousness absurdity , could understood many obstacles , perhaps , crimes still overcome commit , get place make way home , possible would flung everything , would gone give , not fear , but simple horror loathing done . feeling loathing especially surged within grew stronger every minute . would not gone box even room anything world . But sort blankness , even dreaminess , begun degrees take possession ; moments forgot , rather , forgot importance , caught trifles . Glancing , however , kitchen seeing bucket half full water bench , bethought washing hands axe . hands sticky blood . dropped axe blade water , snatched piece soap lay broken saucer window , began washing hands bucket . clean , took axe , washed blade spent long time , three minutes , washing wood spots blood rubbing soap . wiped linen hanging dry line kitchen long attentively examining axe window . no trace left , wood still damp . carefully hung axe noose coat . far possible , dim light kitchen , looked overcoat , trousers boots . first glance seemed nothing but stains boots . wetted rag rubbed boots . But knew not looking thoroughly , might something quite noticeable overlooking . stood middle room , lost thought . Dark agonising ideas rose mind -- idea mad moment incapable reasoning , protecting , ought perhaps something utterly different . “ Good God ! ” muttered , “ must fly , fly , ” rushed entry . But shock terror awaited never known . stood gazed could not believe eyes : door , outer door stairs , not long waited rung , standing unfastened least six inches open . No lock , no bolt , time , time ! old woman not shut perhaps precaution . But , good God ! , seen Lizaveta afterwards ! could , could failed reflect must come somehow ! could not come wall ! dashed door fastened latch . “ But no , wrong thing ! must get away , get away .... ” unfastened latch , opened door began listening staircase . listened long time . Somewhere far away , might gateway , two voices loudly shrilly shouting , quarrelling scolding . “ ? ” waited patiently . last still , though suddenly cut ; separated . meaning go , but suddenly , floor , door noisily opened someone began going downstairs humming tune . “ make noise ? ” flashed mind . closed door waited . last still , not soul stirring . taking step towards stairs heard fresh footsteps . steps sounded far , bottom stairs , but remembered quite clearly distinctly first sound began reason suspect someone coming _there_ , fourth floor , old woman . ? sounds somehow peculiar , significant ? steps heavy , even unhurried . _he_ passed first floor , mounting higher , growing distinct ! could hear heavy breathing . third storey reached . Coming ! seemed turned stone , like dream one pursued , nearly caught killed , rooted spot not even move one ’ arms . last unknown mounting fourth floor , suddenly started , succeeded slipping neatly quickly back flat closing door behind . took hook softly , noiselessly , fixed catch . Instinct helped . done , crouched holding breath , door . unknown visitor also door . standing opposite one another , standing old woman , door divided listening . visitor panted several times . “ must big , fat man , ” thought Raskolnikov , squeezing axe hand . seemed like dream indeed . visitor took hold bell rang loudly . soon tin bell tinkled , Raskolnikov seemed aware something moving room . seconds listened quite seriously . unknown rang , waited suddenly tugged violently impatiently handle door . Raskolnikov gazed horror hook shaking fastening , blank terror expected every minute fastening would pulled . certainly seem possible , violently shaking . tempted hold fastening , but _he_ might aware . giddiness came . “ shall fall ! ” flashed mind , but unknown began speak recovered . “ ’ ? asleep murdered ? D-damn ! ” bawled thick voice , “ Hey , Alyona Ivanovna , old witch ! Lizaveta Ivanovna , hey , my beauty ! open door ! Oh , damn ! asleep ? ” , enraged , tugged might dozen times bell . must certainly man authority intimate acquaintance . moment light hurried steps heard not far , stairs . Someone else approaching . Raskolnikov not heard first . “ ’ say ’ no one home , ” new-comer cried cheerful , ringing voice , addressing first visitor , still went pulling bell . “ Good evening , Koch. ” “ voice must quite young , ” thought Raskolnikov . “ devil tell ? ’ almost broken lock , ” answered Koch . “ But come know ? ” “ ! day yesterday beat three times running billiards Gambrinus ’ . ” “ Oh ! ” “ not home ? ’ queer . ’ awfully stupid though . could old woman gone ? ’ come business. ” “ Yes ; business , too. ” “ Well , ? Go back , suppose , Aie -- aie ! hoping get money ! ” cried young man . “ must give , course , but fix time ? old witch fixed time come . ’ my way . devil got , ’ make . sits year ’ end year ’ end , old hag ; legs bad yet sudden walk ! ” “ ’ better ask porter ? ” “ ? ” “ ’ gone ’ back. ” “ Hm .... Damn ! ... might ask .... But know never go anywhere. ” tugged door-handle . “ Damn . ’ nothing done , must go ! ” “ Stay ! ” cried young man suddenly . “ see door shakes pull ? ” “ Well ? ” “ shows ’ not locked , but fastened hook ! hear hook clanks ? ” “ Well ? ” “ , ’ see ? proves one home . , would locked door outside key not hook inside . , hear hook clanking ? fasten hook inside must home , ’ see ? sitting inside ’ open door ! ” “ Well ! must ! ” cried Koch , astonished . “ ? ” began furiously shaking door . “ Stay ! ” cried young man . “ ’ pull ! must something wrong .... , ’ ringing pulling door still ’ open ! either ’ fainted ... ” “ ? ” “ tell . Let ’ go fetch porter , let wake up. ” “ right. ” going . “ Stay . stop run porter. ” “ ? ” “ Well , ’ better. ” “ right. ” “ ’ studying law see ! ’ evident , e-vi-dent ’ something wrong ! ” young man cried hotly , ran downstairs . Koch remained . softly touched bell gave one tinkle , gently , though reflecting looking , began touching door-handle pulling letting go make sure fastened hook . puffing panting bent began looking keyhole : but key lock inside nothing could seen . Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold axe . sort delirium . even making ready fight come . knocking talking together , idea several times occurred end shout door . tempted swear , jeer , could not open door ! “ make haste ! ” thought flashed mind . “ But devil ? ... ” Time passing , one minute , another -- no one came . Koch began restless . “ devil ? ” cried suddenly impatience deserting sentry duty , , , went , hurrying thumping heavy boots stairs . steps died away . “ Good heavens ! ? ” Raskolnikov unfastened hook , opened door -- no sound . Abruptly , without thought , went , closing door thoroughly could , went downstairs . gone three flights suddenly heard loud voice -- could go ! nowhere hide . going back flat . “ Hey ! Catch brute ! ” Somebody dashed flat , shouting , rather fell ran stairs , bawling top voice . “ Mitka ! Mitka ! Mitka ! Mitka ! Mitka ! Blast ! ” shout ended shriek ; last sounds came yard ; still . But instant several men talking loud fast began noisily mounting stairs . three four . distinguished ringing voice young man . “ Hey ! ” Filled despair went straight meet , feeling “ come must ! ” stopped -- lost ; let pass -- lost ; would remember . approaching ; flight -- suddenly deliverance ! steps right , empty flat door wide open , flat second floor painters work , , though benefit , left . , no doubt , run , shouting . floor painted , middle room stood pail broken pot paint brushes . one instant whisked open door hidden behind wall nick time ; already reached landing . turned went fourth floor , talking loudly . waited , went tiptoe ran stairs . No one stairs , gateway . passed quickly gateway turned left street . knew , knew perfectly well moment flat , greatly astonished finding unlocked , door fastened , looking bodies , another minute passed would guess completely realise murderer , succeeded hiding somewhere , slipping escaping . would guess likely empty flat , going upstairs . meanwhile dared not quicken pace much , though next turning still nearly hundred yards away . “ slip gateway wait somewhere unknown street ? No , hopeless ! fling away axe ? take cab ? Hopeless , hopeless ! ” last reached turning . turned dead alive . half way safety , understood ; less risky great crowd people , lost like grain sand . But suffered weakened could scarcely move . Perspiration ran drops , neck wet . “ My word , going ! ” someone shouted came canal bank . dimly conscious , farther went worse . remembered however , coming canal bank , alarmed finding people conspicuous , thought turning back . Though almost falling fatigue , went long way round get home quite different direction . not fully conscious passed gateway house ! already staircase recollected axe . yet grave problem , put back escape observation far possible . course incapable reflecting might perhaps far better not restore axe , but drop later somebody ’ yard .

Raskolnikov , not waiting introduction , bowed Porfiry Petrovitch , stood middle room looking inquiringly . held hand shook hands , still apparently making desperate efforts subdue mirth utter words introduce . But no sooner succeeded assuming serious air muttering something suddenly glanced though accidentally Razumihin , could no longer control : stifled laughter broke irresistibly tried restrain . extraordinary ferocity Razumihin received “ spontaneous ” mirth gave whole scene appearance genuine fun naturalness . Razumihin strengthened impression though purpose . “ Fool ! fiend , ” roared , waving arm struck little round table empty tea-glass . Everything sent flying crashing . “ But break chairs , gentlemen ? know ’ loss Crown , ” Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily . Raskolnikov still laughing , hand Porfiry Petrovitch ’ , but anxious not overdo , awaited right moment put natural end . Razumihin , completely put confusion upsetting table smashing glass , gazed gloomily fragments , cursed turned sharply window stood looking back company fiercely scowling countenance , seeing nothing . Porfiry Petrovitch laughed ready go laughing , but obviously looked explanations . Zametov sitting corner , but rose visitors ’ entrance standing expectation smile lips , though looked surprise even seemed incredulity whole scene Raskolnikov certain embarrassment . Zametov ’ unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov unpleasantly . “ ’ got think , ” thought . “ Excuse , please , ” began , affecting extreme embarrassment . “ Raskolnikov. ” “ Not , pleasant see ... pleasantly ’ come .... , ’ even say good-morning ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch nodded Razumihin . “ Upon my honour ’ know rage . told came along like Romeo ... proved . , think ! ” “ Pig ! ” ejaculated Razumihin , without turning round . “ must grave grounds , furious word , ” Porfiry laughed . “ Oh , sharp lawyer ! ...

But brief coherent phrases Raskolnikov explained business clearly exactly , well satisfied even succeeded taking good look Porfiry . Porfiry Petrovitch not take eyes . Razumihin , sitting opposite table , listened warmly impatiently , looking one every moment rather excessive interest . “ Fool , ” Raskolnikov swore . “ give information police , ” Porfiry replied , businesslike air , “ learnt incident , murder , beg inform lawyer charge case things belong , desire redeem ... ... but write you. ” “ ’ point , present moment , ” Raskolnikov tried utmost feign embarrassment , “ not quite funds ... even trifling sum beyond ... wanted , see , present declare things mine , money .... ” “ ’ no matter , ” answered Porfiry Petrovitch , receiving explanation pecuniary position coldly , “ but , prefer , write straight , say , informed matter , claiming property , beg ... ” “ ordinary sheet paper ? ” Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly , interested financial side question . “ Oh , ordinary , ” suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked obvious irony , screwing eyes , , winking .

Raskolnikov shuddered , but Porfiry not seem looking , still concerned Razumihin ’ cigarette . “ ? Expecting ? , know pledges _there_ ? ” cried Razumihin . Porfiry Petrovitch addressed Raskolnikov . “ things , ring watch , wrapped together , paper name legibly written pencil , together date left ... ” “ observant ! ” Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly , utmost look straight face , but failed , suddenly added : “ say suppose great many pledges ... must difficult remember .... But remember clearly , ... ... ” “ Stupid !

But moment , struck strangeness frankness , eagerness made explanation , though kept preceding conversation gloomy repulsion , obviously motive , necessity . “ getting relish certain aspects ! ” thought . But almost instant became suddenly uneasy , though unexpected alarming idea occurred . uneasiness kept increasing . reached entrance Bakaleyev ’ . “ Go alone ! ” said Raskolnikov suddenly . “ back directly. ” “ going ? , here. ” “ ’ help .... come half hour . Tell them. ” “ Say like , come you. ” “ , , want torture ! ” screamed , bitter irritation , despair eyes Razumihin ’ hands dropped . stood time steps , looking gloomily Raskolnikov striding rapidly away direction lodging . last , gritting teeth clenching fist , swore would squeeze Porfiry like lemon day , went stairs reassure Pulcheria Alexandrovna , alarmed long absence . Raskolnikov got home , hair soaked sweat breathing heavily . went rapidly stairs , walked unlocked room fastened latch . senseless terror rushed corner , hole paper put things ; put hand , minutes felt carefully hole , every crack fold paper . Finding nothing , got drew deep breath . reaching steps Bakaleyev ’ , suddenly fancied something , chain , stud even bit paper wrapped old woman ’ handwriting , might somehow slipped lost crack , might suddenly turn unexpected , conclusive evidence . stood though lost thought , strange , humiliated , half senseless smile strayed lips . took cap last went quietly room . ideas tangled . went dreamily gateway . “ , ” shouted loud voice . raised head . porter standing door little room pointing short man looked like artisan , wearing long coat waistcoat , looking distance remarkably like woman . stooped , head greasy cap hung forward . wrinkled flabby face looked fifty ; little eyes lost fat looked grimly , sternly discontentedly . “ ? ” Raskolnikov asked , going porter . man stole look brows looked attentively , deliberately ; turned slowly went gate street without saying word . “ ? ” cried Raskolnikov . “ , asking whether student lived , mentioned name lodged . saw coming pointed went away . ’ funny. ” porter seemed rather puzzled , but not much , wondering moment turned went back room . Raskolnikov ran stranger , caught sight walking along side street even , deliberate step eyes fixed ground , though meditation . soon overtook , but time walked behind . last , moving level , looked face . man noticed , looked quickly , but dropped eyes ; walked minute side side without uttering word . “ inquiring ... porter ? ” Raskolnikov said last , but curiously quiet voice . man made no answer ; ’ even look . silent . “ ... come ask ... say nothing .... ’ meaning ? ” Raskolnikov ’ voice broke seemed unable articulate words clearly . man raised eyes time turned gloomy sinister look Raskolnikov . “ Murderer ! ” said suddenly quiet but clear distinct voice . Raskolnikov went walking beside . legs felt suddenly weak , cold shiver ran spine , heart seemed stand still moment , suddenly began throbbing though set free . walked hundred paces , side side silence . man not look . “ mean ... .... murderer ? ” muttered Raskolnikov hardly audibly . “ _You_ murderer , ” man answered still articulately emphatically , smile triumphant hatred , looked straight Raskolnikov ’ pale face stricken eyes . reached cross-roads . man turned left without looking behind . Raskolnikov remained standing , gazing . saw turn round fifty paces away look back still standing . Raskolnikov could not see clearly , but fancied smiling smile cold hatred triumph . slow faltering steps , shaking knees , Raskolnikov made way back little garret , feeling chilled . took cap put table , ten minutes stood without moving . sank exhausted sofa weak moan pain stretched . lay half hour . thought nothing . thoughts fragments thoughts , images without order coherence floated mind -- faces people seen childhood met somewhere , would never recalled , belfry church V. , billiard table restaurant officers playing billiards , smell cigars underground tobacco shop , tavern room , back staircase quite dark , sloppy dirty water strewn egg-shells , Sunday bells floating somewhere .... images followed one another , whirling like hurricane . liked tried clutch , but faded oppression within , but not overwhelming , sometimes even pleasant .... slight shivering still persisted , but almost pleasant sensation . heard hurried footsteps Razumihin ; closed eyes pretended asleep . Razumihin opened door stood time doorway though hesitating , stepped softly room went cautiously sofa . Raskolnikov heard Nastasya ’ whisper : “ ’ disturb !

But living outside time , repairs done . ’ almost finished .... Government quarters , know , capital thing . Eh , think ? ” “ Yes , capital thing , ” answered Raskolnikov , looking almost ironically . “ capital thing , capital thing , ” repeated Porfiry Petrovitch , though thought something quite different . “ Yes , capital thing , ” almost shouted last , suddenly staring Raskolnikov stopping short two steps . stupid repetition incongruous ineptitude serious , brooding enigmatic glance turned upon visitor . But stirred Raskolnikov ’ spleen ever could not resist ironical rather incautious challenge . “ Tell , please , ” asked suddenly , looking almost insolently taking kind pleasure insolence . “ believe ’ sort legal rule , sort legal tradition -- investigating lawyers -- begin attack afar , trivial , least irrelevant subject , encourage , rather , divert man cross-examining , disarm caution give unexpected knock-down blow fatal question . ’ ? ’ sacred tradition , mentioned , fancy , manuals art ? ” “ Yes , yes .... , imagine spoke government quarters ... eh ? ” said Porfiry Petrovitch screwed eyes winked ; good-humoured , crafty look passed face . wrinkles forehead smoothed , eyes contracted , features broadened suddenly went nervous prolonged laugh , shaking looking Raskolnikov straight face . latter forced laugh , , but Porfiry , seeing laughing , broke guffaw turned almost crimson , Raskolnikov ’ repulsion overcame precaution ; left laughing , scowled stared hatred Porfiry , keeping eyes fixed intentionally prolonged laughter lasted . lack precaution sides , however , Porfiry Petrovitch seemed laughing visitor ’ face little disturbed annoyance visitor received . latter fact significant Raskolnikov ’ eyes : saw Porfiry Petrovitch not embarrassed either , but , Raskolnikov , perhaps fallen trap ; must something , motive unknown ; , perhaps , everything readiness another moment would break upon ... went straight point , rose seat took cap . “ Porfiry Petrovitch , ” began resolutely , though considerable irritation , “ yesterday expressed desire come inquiries ” ( laid special stress word “ inquiries ” ) . “ come anything ask , ask , not , allow withdraw . no time spare .... funeral man run , ... know also , ” added , feeling angry made addition irritated anger . “ sick , hear ? long . ’ partly made ill . short , ” shouted , feeling phrase illness still place , “ short , kindly examine let go , . must examine , proper form ! not allow otherwise , meanwhile , good-bye , evidently nothing keep us now. ” “ Good heavens ! mean ? shall question ? ” cackled Porfiry Petrovitch change tone , instantly leaving laughing . “ Please ’ disturb , ” began fidgeting place place fussily making Raskolnikov sit . “ ’ no hurry , ’ no hurry , ’ nonsense .

Raskolnikov suddenly noticed ran room seemed twice stop moment near door , though listening . “ expecting anything ? ” “ certainly quite right , ” Porfiry began gaily , looking extraordinary simplicity Raskolnikov ( startled instantly put guard ) ; “ certainly quite right laughing wittily legal forms , he-he ! elaborate psychological methods exceedingly ridiculous perhaps useless , one adheres closely forms .

Anyhow , hoped . “ No , see ’ believe , think playing harmless joke , ” Porfiry began , getting lively , chuckling every instant pacing round room . “ sure ’ right : God given figure awaken none but comic ideas people ; buffoon ; but let tell , repeat , excuse old man , my dear Rodion Romanovitch , man still young , say , first youth put intellect everything , like young people .

Nearly ten twenty roubles , given Raskolnikov Marmeladov ’ funeral , wasted upon . Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged honour memory deceased “ suitably , ” lodgers , still Amalia Ivanovna , might know “ no way inferior , perhaps much superior , ” no one right “ turn nose him. ” Perhaps chief element peculiar “ poor man ’ pride , ” compels many poor people spend last savings traditional social ceremony , simply order “ like people , ” not “ looked upon. ” probable , , Katerina Ivanovna longed occasion , moment seemed abandoned everyone , show “ wretched contemptible lodgers ” knew “ things , entertain ” brought “ genteel , might almost say aristocratic colonel ’ family ” not meant sweeping floors washing children ’ rags night .

Everything well done . Even table-cloth nearly clean ; crockery , knives , forks glasses , course , shapes patterns , lent different lodgers , but table properly laid time fixed , Amalia Ivanovna , feeling done work well , put black silk dress cap new mourning ribbons met returning party pride . pride , though justifiable , displeased Katerina Ivanovna reason : “ though table could not laid except Amalia Ivanovna ! ” disliked cap new ribbons , . “ Could stuck , stupid German , mistress house , consented favour help poor lodgers ! favour !

Police , police ! ” yelled Amalia Ivanovna . “ must Siberia sent ! Away ! ” Exclamations arose sides . Raskolnikov silent , keeping eyes fixed Sonia , except occasional rapid glance Luzhin . Sonia stood still , though unconscious . hardly able feel surprise . Suddenly colour rushed cheeks ; uttered cry hid face hands . “ No , ’ ! ’ take ! know nothing , ” cried heartrending wail , ran Katerina Ivanovna , clasped tightly arms , though would shelter world . “ Sonia !

Exclamations arose hands chiefly expressive wonder , but menacing tone . crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch . Katerina Ivanovna flew Lebeziatnikov . “ mistaken ! Protect ! one take part ! orphan .

But speech produced powerful effect . spoken vehemence , conviction everyone obviously believed . Pyotr Petrovitch felt things going badly . “ silly ideas occur ? ” shouted , “ ’ no evidence . may dreamt , ’ ! tell , lying , sir . lying slandering spite , simply pique , not agree free-thinking , godless , social propositions ! ” But retort not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch . Murmurs disapproval heard sides . “ Ah , ’ line , ! ” cried Lebeziatnikov , “ ’ nonsense ! Call police ’ take my oath ! ’ one thing ’ understand : made risk contemptible action . Oh , pitiful , despicable man ! ” “ explain risked action , necessary , , , swear , ” Raskolnikov said last firm voice , stepped forward . appeared firm composed .

But not present drunk ; lodgers came rooms . three Poles tremendously excited continually shouting : “ _pan_ _lajdak_ ! ” muttering threats Polish .

Katerina Ivanovna breathed hard painfully seemed fearfully exhausted . Amalia Ivanovna stood looking stupid anyone , mouth wide open , unable make happened . saw Pyotr Petrovitch somehow come grief . Raskolnikov attempting speak , but not let . Everyone crowding round Luzhin threats shouts abuse . But Pyotr Petrovitch not intimidated .

But yard empty could not see hammering . house left saw open windows ; window-sills pots sickly-looking geraniums . Linen hung windows ... knew heart . turned away sat sofa . Never , never felt fearfully alone ! Yes , felt would perhaps come hate Sonia , made miserable . “ gone beg tears ? need poison life ?

Recalling period long , believed mind clouded times , continued , intervals , till final catastrophe . convinced mistaken many things time , instance date certain events . Anyway , tried later piece recollections together , learnt great deal people told . mixed incidents explained events due circumstances existed imagination . times prey agonies morbid uneasiness , amounting sometimes panic . But remembered , , moments , hours , perhaps whole days , complete apathy , came upon reaction previous terror might compared abnormal insensibility , sometimes seen dying . seemed trying latter stage escape full clear understanding position . Certain essential facts required immediate consideration particularly irksome . glad would free cares , neglect would threatened complete , inevitable ruin . particularly worried Svidrigaïlov , might said permanently thinking Svidrigaïlov . time Svidrigaïlov ’ menacing unmistakable words Sonia ’ room moment Katerina Ivanovna ’ death , normal working mind seemed break . But although new fact caused extreme uneasiness , Raskolnikov no hurry explanation . times , finding solitary remote part town , wretched eating-house , sitting alone lost thought , hardly knowing come , suddenly thought Svidrigaïlov . recognised suddenly , clearly , dismay ought come understanding man make terms could . Walking outside city gates one day , positively fancied fixed meeting , waiting Svidrigaïlov . Another time woke daybreak lying ground bushes could not first understand come . But two three days Katerina Ivanovna ’ death , two three times met Svidrigaïlov Sonia ’ lodging , gone aimlessly moment . exchanged words made no reference vital subject , though tacitly agreed not speak time . Katerina Ivanovna ’ body still lying coffin , Svidrigaïlov busy making arrangements funeral . Sonia busy . last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov made arrangement , satisfactory one , Katerina Ivanovna ’ children ; , certain connections , succeeded getting hold certain personages whose help three orphans could placed suitable institutions ; money settled great assistance , much easier place orphans property destitute ones . said something Sonia promised come day two see Raskolnikov , mentioning “ would like consult , things must talk .... ” conversation took place passage stairs . Svidrigaïlov looked intently Raskolnikov suddenly , brief pause , dropping voice , asked : “ But , Rodion Romanovitch ; ’ seem ? look listen , but ’ seem understand . Cheer ! ’ talk things ; sorry , ’ much my business people ’ . Ah , Rodion Romanovitch , ” added suddenly , “ men need fresh air , fresh air ... anything ! ” moved one side make way priest server , coming stairs . come requiem service . Svidrigaïlov ’ orders sung twice day punctually . Svidrigaïlov went way . Raskolnikov stood still moment , thought , followed priest Sonia ’ room . stood door . began quietly , slowly mournfully singing service . childhood thought death presence death something oppressive mysteriously awful ; long since heard requiem service . something else well , awful disturbing . looked children : kneeling coffin ; Polenka weeping . Behind Sonia prayed , softly , , timidly weeping . “ last two days ’ said word , ’ glanced , ” Raskolnikov thought suddenly . sunlight bright room ; incense rose clouds ; priest read , “ Give rest , oh Lord .... ” Raskolnikov stayed service . blessed took leave , priest looked round strangely . service , Raskolnikov went Sonia . took hands let head sink shoulder . slight friendly gesture bewildered Raskolnikov . seemed strange no trace repugnance , no trace disgust , no tremor hand . furthest limit self-abnegation , least interpreted . Sonia said nothing . Raskolnikov pressed hand went . felt miserable . possible escape solitude , would thought lucky , even spend whole life . But although almost always late , never able feel alone . Sometimes walked town high road , even reached little wood , but lonelier place , seemed aware uneasy presence near . not frighten , but greatly annoyed , made haste return town , mingle crowd , enter restaurants taverns , walk busy thoroughfares . felt easier even solitary . One day dusk sat hour listening songs tavern remembered positively enjoyed . But last suddenly felt uneasiness , though conscience smote . “ sit listening singing , ought ? ” thought . Yet felt not cause uneasiness ; something requiring immediate decision , but something could not clearly understand put words . hopeless tangle . “ No , better struggle ! Better Porfiry ... Svidrigaïlov .... Better challenge ... attack . Yes , yes ! ” thought . went tavern rushed away almost run . thought Dounia mother suddenly reduced almost panic . night woke morning among bushes Krestovsky Island , trembling fever ; walked home , early morning arrived . hours ’ sleep fever left , but woke late , two ’ clock afternoon . remembered Katerina Ivanovna ’ funeral fixed day , glad not present .

But no sooner opened door stumbled upon Porfiry passage . coming see . Raskolnikov dumbfounded minute , but one minute . Strange say , not much astonished seeing Porfiry scarcely afraid . simply startled , but quickly , instantly , guard . “ Perhaps mean end ?

Raskolnikov seated directly facing Porfiry , looked without flinching . Porfiry screwed eyes began lighting cigarette . “ Speak , speak , ” seemed though would burst Raskolnikov ’ heart . “ Come , ’ speak ? ” CHAPTER II “ Ah cigarettes ! ” Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated last , lighted one . “ pernicious , positively pernicious , yet ’ give ! cough , begin tickling my throat difficulty breathing . know coward , went lately Dr. B -- -- n ; always gives least half hour patient . positively laughed looking ; sounded : ‘ Tobacco ’ bad , ’ said , ‘ lungs affected. ’ But give ? take place ? ’ drink , ’ mischief , he-he-he , ’ .

Dounia waiting . come morning , remembering Svidrigaïlov ’ words Sonia knew . not describe conversation tears two girls , friendly became . Dounia gained one comfort least interview , brother would not alone . gone , Sonia , first confession ; gone human fellowship needed ; would go wherever fate might send . Dounia not ask , but knew . looked Sonia almost reverence first almost embarrassed . Sonia almost point tears . felt , contrary , hardly worthy look Dounia . Dounia ’ gracious image bowed attentively respectfully first meeting Raskolnikov ’ room remained mind one fairest visions life . Dounia last became impatient , leaving Sonia , went brother ’ room await ; kept thinking would come first . gone , Sonia began tortured dread committing suicide , Dounia feared . But spent day trying persuade could not , less anxious together . soon parted , thought nothing else . Sonia remembered Svidrigaïlov said day Raskolnikov two alternatives -- Siberia ...

Water brought . “ ... ” began Raskolnikov . “ Drink water. ” Raskolnikov refused water hand , softly brokenly , but distinctly said : “ _It killed old pawnbroker woman sister Lizaveta axe robbed them._ ” Ilya Petrovitch opened mouth . People ran sides . Raskolnikov repeated statement . EPILOGUE Siberia . banks broad solitary river stands town , one administrative centres Russia ; town fortress , fortress prison . prison second-class convict Rodion Raskolnikov confined nine months . Almost year half passed since crime . little difficulty trial . criminal adhered exactly , firmly , clearly statement . not confuse misrepresent facts , soften interest , omit smallest detail . explained every incident murder , secret _the pledge_ ( piece wood strip metal ) found murdered woman ’ hand . described minutely taken keys , like , well chest contents ; explained mystery Lizaveta ’ murder ; described Koch , , student knocked , repeated said one another ; afterwards run downstairs heard Nikolay Dmitri shouting ; hidden empty flat afterwards gone home . ended indicating stone yard Voznesensky Prospect purse trinkets found . whole thing , fact , perfectly clear . lawyers judges much struck , among things , fact hidden trinkets purse stone , without making use , , , not remember trinkets like , even many . fact never opened purse not even know much seemed incredible . turned purse three hundred seventeen roubles sixty copecks . long stone , valuable notes lying uppermost suffered damp . long trying discover accused man tell lie , everything else made truthful straightforward confession . Finally lawyers versed psychology admitted possible really not looked purse , ’ know hid stone . But immediately drew deduction crime could committed temporary mental derangement , homicidal mania , without object pursuit gain . fell recent fashionable theory temporary insanity , often applied days criminal cases . Moreover Raskolnikov ’ hypochondriacal condition proved many witnesses , Dr. Zossimov , former fellow students , landlady servant . pointed strongly conclusion Raskolnikov not quite like ordinary murderer robber , but another element case . intense annoyance maintained opinion , criminal scarcely attempted defend . decisive question motive impelled murder robbery , answered clearly coarsest frankness cause miserable position , poverty helplessness , desire provide first steps life help three thousand roubles reckoned finding . led murder shallow cowardly nature , exasperated moreover privation failure . question led confess , answered heartfelt repentance . almost coarse .... sentence however merciful could expected , perhaps partly criminal not tried justify , but rather shown desire exaggerate guilt . strange peculiar circumstances crime taken consideration . could no doubt abnormal poverty-stricken condition criminal time . fact made no use stolen put partly effect remorse , partly abnormal mental condition time crime . Incidentally murder Lizaveta served indeed confirm last hypothesis : man commits two murders forgets door open ! Finally , confession , moment case hopelessly muddled false evidence given Nikolay melancholy fanaticism , , moreover , no proofs real criminal , no suspicions even ( Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept word ) -- much soften sentence . circumstances , , prisoner ’ favour came quite unexpectedly . Razumihin somehow discovered proved Raskolnikov university helped poor consumptive fellow student spent last penny supporting six months , student died , leaving decrepit old father maintained almost thirteenth year , Raskolnikov got old man hospital paid funeral died . Raskolnikov ’ landlady bore witness , , lived another house Five Corners , Raskolnikov rescued two little children house fire burnt . investigated fairly well confirmed many witnesses . facts made impression favour . end criminal , consideration extenuating circumstances , condemned penal servitude second class term eight years . beginning trial Raskolnikov ’ mother fell ill. Dounia Razumihin found possible get Petersburg trial . Razumihin chose town railway not far Petersburg , able follow every step trial time see Avdotya Romanovna often possible . Pulcheria Alexandrovna ’ illness strange nervous one accompanied partial derangement intellect . Dounia returned last interview brother , found mother already ill , feverish delirium . evening Razumihin agreed answers must make mother ’ questions Raskolnikov made complete story mother ’ benefit go away distant part Russia business commission , would bring end money reputation . But struck fact Pulcheria Alexandrovna never asked anything subject , neither thereafter . contrary , version son ’ sudden departure ; told tears come say good-bye , hinting alone knew many mysterious important facts , Rodya many powerful enemies , necessary hiding . future career , no doubt would brilliant certain sinister influences could removed . assured Razumihin son would one day great statesman , article brilliant literary talent proved . article continually reading , even read aloud , almost took bed , but scarcely asked Rodya , though subject obviously avoided others , might enough awaken suspicions . began frightened last Pulcheria Alexandrovna ’ strange silence certain subjects . not , instance , complain getting no letters , though previous years lived hope letters beloved Rodya . cause great uneasiness Dounia ; idea occurred mother suspected something terrible son ’ fate afraid ask , fear hearing something still awful . case , Dounia saw clearly mother not full possession faculties . happened twice , however , Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave turn conversation impossible answer without mentioning Rodya , receiving unsatisfactory suspicious answers became gloomy silent , mood lasted long time . Dounia saw last hard deceive came conclusion better absolutely silent certain points ; but became evident poor mother suspected something terrible . Dounia remembered brother ’ telling mother overheard talking sleep night interview Svidrigaïlov fatal day confession : not made something ? Sometimes days even weeks gloomy silence tears would succeeded period hysterical animation , invalid would begin talk almost incessantly son , hopes future .... fancies sometimes strange . humoured , pretended agree ( saw perhaps pretending ) , but still went talking . Five months Raskolnikov ’ confession , sentenced . Razumihin Sonia saw prison often possible . last moment separation came . Dounia swore brother separation not ever , Razumihin . Razumihin , youthful ardour , firmly resolved lay foundations least secure livelihood next three four years , saving certain sum , emigrate Siberia , country rich every natural resource need workers , active men capital . would settle town Rodya together would begin new life . wept parting . Raskolnikov dreamy days . asked great deal mother constantly anxious . worried much alarmed Dounia . heard mother ’ illness became gloomy . Sonia particularly reserved time . help money left Svidrigaïlov , Sonia long ago made preparations follow party convicts despatched Siberia . Not word passed Raskolnikov subject , but knew would . final leave-taking smiled strangely sister ’ Razumihin ’ fervent anticipations happy future together come prison . predicted mother ’ illness would soon fatal ending . Sonia last set . Two months later Dounia married Razumihin . quiet sorrowful wedding ; Porfiry Petrovitch Zossimov invited however . period Razumihin wore air resolute determination . Dounia put implicit faith carrying plans indeed could not but believe . displayed rare strength . Among things began attending university lectures order take degree . continually making plans future ; counted settling Siberia within five years least . Till rested hopes Sonia . Pulcheria Alexandrovna delighted give blessing Dounia ’ marriage Razumihin ; but marriage became even melancholy anxious . give pleasure Razumihin told Raskolnikov looked poor student decrepit father year ago burnt injured rescuing two little children fire . two pieces news excited Pulcheria Alexandrovna ’ disordered imagination almost ecstasy . continually talking , even entering conversation strangers street , though Dounia always accompanied . public conveyances shops , wherever could capture listener , would begin discourse son , article , helped student , burnt fire , ! Dounia not know restrain . Apart danger morbid excitement , risk someone ’ recalling Raskolnikov ’ name speaking recent trial . Pulcheria Alexandrovna found address mother two children son saved insisted going see . last restlessness reached extreme point . would sometimes begin cry suddenly often ill feverishly delirious . One morning declared reckoning Rodya ought soon home , remembered said good-bye said must expect back nine months . began prepare coming , began room , clean furniture , wash put new hangings . Dounia anxious , but said nothing helped arrange room . fatiguing day spent continual fancies , joyful day-dreams tears , Pulcheria Alexandrovna taken ill night morning feverish delirious . brain fever . died within fortnight . delirium dropped words showed knew great deal son ’ terrible fate supposed . long time Raskolnikov not know mother ’ death , though regular correspondence maintained time reached Siberia . carried means Sonia , wrote every month Razumihins received answer unfailing regularity . first found Sonia ’ letters dry unsatisfactory , but later came conclusion letters could not better , letters received complete picture unfortunate brother ’ life . Sonia ’ letters full matter-of-fact detail , simplest clearest description Raskolnikov ’ surroundings convict . no word hopes , no conjecture future , no description feelings . Instead attempt interpret state mind inner life , gave simple facts -- , words , exact account health , asked interviews , commission gave . facts gave extraordinary minuteness . picture unhappy brother stood last great clearness precision . could no mistake , nothing given but facts . But Dounia husband could get little comfort news , especially first . Sonia wrote constantly sullen not ready talk , scarcely seemed interested news gave letters , sometimes asked mother , seeing guessed truth , told last death , surprised find not seem greatly affected , not externally rate . told , although seemed wrapped , , shut everyone -- took direct simple view new life ; understood position , expected nothing better time , no ill-founded hopes ( common position ) scarcely seemed surprised anything surroundings , unlike anything known . wrote health satisfactory ; work without shirking seeking ; almost indifferent food , but except Sundays holidays food bad last glad accept money , Sonia , tea every day . begged not trouble anything else , declaring fuss annoyed . Sonia wrote prison shared room rest , not seen inside barracks , but concluded crowded , miserable unhealthy ; slept plank bed rug unwilling make arrangement . But lived poorly roughly , not plan design , but simply inattention indifference . Sonia wrote simply first shown no interest visits , almost vexed indeed coming , unwilling talk rude . But end visits become habit almost necessity , positively distressed ill days could not visit . used see holidays prison gates guard-room , brought minutes see . working days would go see work either workshops brick kilns , sheds banks Irtish . , Sonia wrote succeeded making acquaintances town , sewing , , scarcely dressmaker town , looked upon indispensable person many houses . But not mention authorities , , interested Raskolnikov ; task lightened . last news came ( Dounia indeed noticed signs alarm uneasiness preceding letters ) held aloof everyone , fellow prisoners not like , kept silent days time becoming pale . last letter Sonia wrote taken seriously ill convict ward hospital .
